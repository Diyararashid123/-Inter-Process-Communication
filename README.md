# Inter-Process-Communication
## This project about making a RTMK operating system. The Operating system we implemented in this project has the capability to run and schedule tasks based on their deadline in real-time. The operating system can also send messages between tasks with help of a mailbox. A mailbox is a type of communication channel that processes can use to send and receive messages between each other. This project was divided into three steps which will be explained in detail in the doc file and then there is a Flowchart that shows how every signel part works in the Image file.

## This project has two parts hardware and software, but the hardware part is small. However, this project is mostly software.
